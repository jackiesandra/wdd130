        <p>I am from Honduras. I have one daughter of ten years old, and we like to watch movies together and eat popcorn. I grew up in the countries of Honduras and Guatemala. Two years ago, I decided to move to the United States with my daughter, and everything changed for us. It was a big challenge, but we are moving forward on this path of learning. I'm online student from BYUI, I study Software Development because my dream is to be a Software engineer and have better future for me and my daughter, Also I want to have my own company and be able to create new jobs for help the economic development of my country too. I'm a very spiritual woman and I'm a member of the church of Jesus Christ of the latter day saints, and we like to go every sunday to the sacramental meeting and feel the spirit with us. I like to visit new places, this country is awesome it has many paradises that I wish to meet all of them at the same time, but it's not possible, sometime I have enough time and I like to make a plan to visit some places with my daughter she is my best companion in the whole word, and we really enjoy together new experiences.</p>
